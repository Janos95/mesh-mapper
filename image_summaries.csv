Directory,Description
needle,"The object is a low-poly, three-dimensional geometric model of a rabbit in a sitting posture with long, erect ears."
34785,"The object is a whistle with a toroidal or ring-like shape, featuring a slot at one end for air passage, and a flange or tab likely for mounting or attachment. It bears the shape of a teardrop or circular segment cut off on one side."
36088,"The object is a simplified 3D representation or model resembling a right-angled, vertical ""L"" shape with a widened base, possibly depicting an architectural feature, letter, or Cartesian coordinate axis."
35269,"The object is a digital 3D model featuring a combination of animal elements including a cat, a manatee, and an octopus. It's characterized by a grey, metallic appearance and high levels of detail giving it a realistic appeal. Key features include a resting cat perched on a dumbbell-shaped structure, a manatee in a floating posture with flippers extended, and octopus traits like a large-eyed, bulbous head and eight detailed tentacles with suction cups."
36086,"The object is a three-dimensional model shaped like a lowercase letter ""d"" that also resembles a stylized megaphone or a simple arrow when viewed from different perspectives."
34783,"The object is a bevel gear, a mechanical cogwheel with angled teeth designed to transmit power between two intersecting shafts, often used in machinery like automotive differentials and helicopters to allow for smooth power transmission and changes in shaft's direction."
34784,"The object described is a type of gear with angled teeth, which could be either a bevel gear typically used for changing the direction of a shaft's rotation, or a helical gear known for smoother, quieter operation and high power transmission often used in automotive transmissions and machinery."
36069,"The object can be described as a cylindrical tube with a closed end and a flared open end, featuring a textured or ribbed surface, composed of an undetermined uniform material."
36082,"The object is a vertical cylindrical structure, likely representing a pipe, tube, canister, or similar item, with a curved surface, consistent diameter, and seems to be closed at the base with one end open."
36090,"The object being described is a 3D lower-case letter ""d"" that also resembles a simple arrow or directional pointer and a bullhorn or megaphone."
